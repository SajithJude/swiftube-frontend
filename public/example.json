      "summary": "The table provides a quick comparison of plant-based and animal-based diets. Plant-based diets are high in nutrients and low in saturated fats, which can reduce the risk of chronic diseases. However, they may require more planning and knowledge to ensure balanced nutrition, as well as being potentially more expensive. On the other hand, animal-based diets can be high in protein and certain vitamins, but also high in saturated fats which have been linked to cancer and heart disease, increasing risk of chronic diseases. Ultimately, individuals should consider their own nutritional needs, budget, and ethical beliefs when choosing their diet."
